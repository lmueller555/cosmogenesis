COSMOGENESIS – `ship_guidance`
(Authoritative Design – **Do Not Modify**)

---

## A. Meta-Rules for the LLM Coder

1. **This `ship_guidance` is authoritative.**

   * You **must not** edit, override, reinterpret, or “improve” this document.
   * You **must not** generate alternate or supplemental guidance documents (e.g., `ship_guidance_v2`, `ship_notes`, `balance_ideas`, etc.).
   * If anything seems ambiguous or missing, you must surface it as a comment/TODO in code and defer to the human designer.

2. **Relationship to `game_guidance`.**

   * This document extends and refines the high-level concepts from `game_guidance`.
   * If there is any conflict, the human designer decides the resolution; you must not unilaterally choose.

3. **No new ships, no removed ships.**

   * You may not invent additional ship types, rename ships, or remove ships from this list.
   * Balance tweaks (numbers) may only be done when explicitly requested by the human designer.

---

## B. Canonical Ship Fields & Conventions

All ships in Cosmogenesis **must** use the following canonical fields (some are already defined in `game_guidance`):

* **name** (string)
* **class** (Strike / Escort / Line / Capital / Base)
* **role** (short description: interceptor, brawler, artillery, etc.)
* **lore_blurb** (very short 1–3 sentence lore/fiction snippet)
* **resource_cost** (integer)
* **build_time** (seconds, float or int)
* **health** (HP pool)
* **armor** (flat damage reduction or armor value used by combat formulas)
* **shields** (shield HP pool)
* **energy** (max energy pool for abilities, weapons, systems)
* **energy_regen** (energy per second)
* **flight_speed** (world units per second)
* **visual_range** (world units)
* **radar_range** (world units; must be ≥ visual_range)
* **firing_range** (world units; the maximum distance that primary weapons can engage)
* **weapon_damage** (base damage per shot or per cycle; details can be expanded later)
* **design_notes_wireframe** (description of wireframe silhouette for the LLM coder)
* **upgrade_hooks** (short notes about likely upgrade paths; do not implement new systems without explicit guidance)

> **Scale Convention (guidance, not a hard law):**
>
> * Strike: cost ~800–1200, build_time ~15–25s, speed ~260–320
> * Escort: cost ~4000–6000, build_time ~30–40s, speed ~200–260
> * Line: cost ~9000–12000, build_time ~45–55s, speed ~150–200
> * Capital: cost ~18000–23000, build_time ~70–85s, speed ~120–160
> * Base: not built like normal ships; it is the starting structure, potentially upgradeable.

Distances (visual, radar, firing range) can be roughly:

* Strike: firing_range ~600–800
* Escort: ~800–1000
* Line: ~1100–1400
* Capital: ~1300–1800
* Base: ~1600–2000

## C. The Base – “ASTRAL CITADEL”

The Base is a **space station / megastructure**, larger than any ship in the fleet. It anchors the player’s operations, harvests resources, and builds ships.

### C.1 Base: Astral Citadel

* **name:** Astral Citadel

* **class:** Base

* **role:** Core station / main base / production hub

* **lore_blurb:**
  The Astral Citadel is a modular fortress-station, assembled from prefabricated rings and spines. Every fleet’s story begins here, as the Citadel’s factories ignite and its mining arrays bite into the surrounding planetoids.

* **resource_cost:** N/A (starting structure; later upgrades may have costs)

* **build_time:** N/A (present at match start; expansions/upgrade modules will have their own times)

* **health:** 40,000

* **armor:** 400

* **shields:** 20,000

* **energy:** 10,000

* **energy_regen:** 60 / second

* **flight_speed:** 0 (stationary)

* **visual_range:** 1400

* **radar_range:** 2000

* **firing_range:** 1800 (defense batteries)

* **weapon_damage:** 250 per defense volley (balanced later; treat as moderate base defense, not a battleship)

* **Capabilities (Conceptual):**

  * **Resource Harvesting:**

    * Hosts mining arrays that connect to nearby planetoids and asteroids.
    * Acts as the central node for resource accounting.
  * **Ship Production:**

    * Maintains multiple **build queues** for Strike, Escort, and later Line & Capital ships (once upgraded).
  * **Defenses:**

    * Basic integrated turrets with modest firing rate and decent range.
    * Defense strength can be upgraded over time (more damage, more range, improved shields).
  * **Upgrade Modules:**

    * Future upgrades may unlock:

      * Capital ship production
      * Advanced ship upgrades
      * Improved radar, larger vision
      * Additional mining throughput

* **design_notes_wireframe:**

  * The Astral Citadel is a **large, layered wireframe structure**:

    * **Central Core:**

      * A large hexagonal or octagonal prism outline, drawn as concentric hex/octal rings stacked along a short vertical axis.
      * Internal cross-bracing lines connecting opposite vertices, giving a “lattice core” look.
    * **Outer Rings:**

      * At least two large circular or hexagonal rings orbiting the core in the same plane (like a compact orbital torus).
      * The outer rings are connected to the core via straight, evenly spaced spokes (4–6 spokes).
    * **Docking Arms:**

      * 3–4 radial “arms” extending outward as long rectangular frameworks with diagonal crossbars.
      * Ships spawn at the open ends of these arms.
    * **Upgrade Attachments (for future visuals):**

      * Reserved “attachment points” at the tips of docking arms and on outer rings where additional small ring segments or spires can be drawn when upgrades are purchased.
      * These should be simple add-on wireframe shapes: small vertical towers, extra mini-rings, or antenna-like trusses.

* **upgrade_hooks:**

  * **Mining Superstructure:** extra outer ring with added radial lines → improves resource income.
  * **Fleet Foundry Module:** new rectangular gantry attached to one arm → unlocks Line/Capital ship production.
  * **Aegis Array:** added vertical spires or “halo” ring above and below → improves shields and radar.
  * All visual changes must be additive (no removing core geometry), to preserve recognition.

## H. Final Reminder to the LLM Coder

* You **must not** modify this `ship_guidance` document or create new guidance documents.
* You **must not** add, remove, or rename ships without explicit direction from the human designer.
* All implementations of ship stats, behaviors, and wireframe designs must follow these specifications as closely as technically feasible.
* Any uncertainty should be handled by:

  1. Choosing the simplest implementation that respects this document and `game_guidance`, and
  2. Leaving a clear comment/TODO for the human designer.
